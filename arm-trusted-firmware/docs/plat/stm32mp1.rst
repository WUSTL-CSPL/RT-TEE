Trusted Firmware-A for STM32MP1
===============================

STM32MP1 is a microprocessor designed by STMicroelectronics
based on a dual Arm Cortex-A7.
It is an Armv7-A platform, using dedicated code from TF-A.


Design
------
The STM32MP1 resets in the ROM code of the Cortex-A7.
The primary boot core (core 0) executes the boot sequence while
secondary boot core (core 1) is kept in a holding pen loop.
The ROM code boot sequence loads the TF-A binary image from boot device
to embedded SRAM.

The TF-A image must be properly formatted with a STM32 header structure
for ROM code is able to load this image.
Tool stm32image can be used to prepend this header to the generated TF-A binary.

At compilation step, BL2, BL32 and DTB file are linked together in a single
binary. The stm32image tool is also generated and the header is added to TF-A
binary. This binary file with header is named tf-a-stm32mp157c-ev1.stm32.
It can then be copied in the first partition of the boot device.

Build Instructions
------------------

To build:

.. code:: bash

    make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- PLAT=stm32mp1 ARCH=aarch32 ARM_ARCH_MAJOR=7 AARCH32_SP=sp_min
    cd <u-boot_directory>
    make stm32mp15_basic_defconfig
    make DEVICE_TREE=stm32mp157c_ev1 all
    ./tools/mkimage -T stm32image -a 0xC0100000 -e 0xC0100000 -d u-boot.bin u-boot.stm32

The following build options are supported:

- ``ENABLE_STACK_PROTECTOR``: To enable the stack protection.


Populate SD-card
----------------

The SD-card has to be formated with GPT.
It should contain at least those partitions:

- fsbl: to copy the tf-a-stm32mp157c-ev1.stm32 binary
- ssbl: to copy the u-boot.stm32 binary

Usually, two copies of fsbl are used (fsbl1 and fsbl2) instead of one partition fsbl.
