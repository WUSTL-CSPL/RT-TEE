=head1 NAME

qemu-qmp-ref - QEMU QMP Reference Manual

=head1 DESCRIPTION




=head2 Introduction


This document describes all commands currently supported by QMP.

Most of the time their usage is exactly the same as in the user Monitor, this
means that any other document which also describe commands (the manpage,
QEMU's manual, etc) can and should be consulted.

QMP has two types of commands: regular and query commands. Regular commands
usually change the Virtual Machine's state someway, while query commands just
return information. The sections below are divided accordingly.

It's important to observe that all communication examples are formatted in
a reader-friendly way, so that they're easier to understand. However, in real
protocol usage, they're emitted as a single line.

Also, the following notation is used to denote data flow:

Example:

	
	-> data issued by the Client


	
	<- Server data response



Please, refer to the QMP specification (docs/interop/qmp-spec.txt) for
detailed information on the Server command and response formats.


=head2 Stability Considerations


The current QMP command set (described in this file) may be useful for a
number of use cases, however it's limited and several commands have bad
defined semantics, specially with regard to command completion.

These problems are going to be solved incrementally in the next QEMU releases
and we're going to establish a deprecation policy for badly defined commands.

If you're planning to adopt QMP, please observe the following:


=over 4


=item 1.

The deprecation policy will take effect and be documented soon, please
check the documentation of each used command as soon as a new release of
QEMU is available


=item 2.

DO NOT rely on anything which is not explicit documented


=item 3.

Errors, in special, are not documented. Applications should NOT check
for specific errors classes or data (it's strongly recommended to only
check for the "error" key)

B<job-pause>  (Command)
Pause an active job.

This command returns immediately after marking the active job for pausing.
Pausing an already paused job is an error.

The job will pause as soon as possible, which means transitioning into the
PAUSED state if it was RUNNING, or into STANDBY if it was READY. The
corresponding JOB_STATUS_CHANGE event will be emitted.

Cancelling a paused job automatically resumes it.

B<Arguments:>

B<job-cancel>  (Command)
Instruct an active background job to cancel at the next opportunity.
This command returns immediately after marking the active job for
cancellation.

The job will cancel as soon as possible and then emit a JOB_STATUS_CHANGE
event. Usually, the status will change to ABORTING, but it is possible that
a job successfully completes (e.g. because it was almost done and there was
no opportunity to cancel earlier than completing the job) and transitions to
PENDING instead.

B<job-dismiss>  (Command)
Deletes a job that is in the CONCLUDED state. This command only needs to be
run explicitly for jobs that don't have automatic dismiss enabled.

This command will refuse to operate on any job that has not yet reached its
terminal state, JOB_STATUS_CONCLUDED. For jobs that make use of JOB_READY
event, job-cancel or job-complete will still need to be used as appropriate.

B<Arguments:>

B<job-finalize>  (Command)
Instructs all jobs in a transaction (or a single job if it is not part of any
transaction) to finalize any graph changes and do any necessary cleanup. This
command requires that all involved jobs are in the PENDING state.

For jobs in a transaction, instructing one job to finalize will force
ALL jobs in the transaction to finalize, so it is only necessary to instruct
a single member job to finalize.

B<BlockMeasureInfo> (Object)


Image file size calculation information.  This structure describes the size
requirements for creating a new image file.

The size requirements depend on the new image file format.  File size always
equals virtual disk size for the 'raw' format, even for sparse POSIX files.
Compact formats such as 'qcow2' represent unallocated and zero regions
efficiently so file size may be smaller than virtual disk size.

The values are upper bounds that are guaranteed to fit the new image file.
Subsequent modification, such as internal snapshot or bitmap creation, may
require additional space and is not covered here.

B<Members:>

=over 4


=item C<required: int>

Size required for a new image file, in bytes.

=item C<fully-allocated: int>

Image file size, in bytes, once data has been written
to all sectors.

B<blockdev-snapshot>  (Command)
Generates a snapshot of a block device.

Create a snapshot, by installing 'node' as the backing image of
'overlay'. Additionally, if 'node' is associated with a block
device, the block device changes to using 'overlay' as its new active
image.

For the arguments, see the documentation of BlockdevSnapshot.

	                    "overlay": "node1534" } }
	<- { "return": {} }







B<change-backing-file>  (Command)
Change the backing file in the image file metadata.  This does not
cause QEMU to reopen the image file to reparse the backing filename
(it may, however, perform a reopen to change permissions from
r/o -E<gt> r/w -E<gt> r/o, if needed). The new backing file string is written
into the image file metadata, and the QEMU internal strings are
updated.

B<Arguments:>

=over 4


=item C<image-node-name: string>

The name of the block driver state node of the
image to modify. The "device" argument is used
to verify "image-node-name" is in the chain
described by "device".

=item C<device: string>

The device name or node-name of the root node that owns
image-node-name.

=item C<backing-file: string>

The string to write as the backing file.  This
string is not validated, so care should be taken
when specifying the string or the image chain may
not be able to be reopened again.

=back


B<Returns:>
Nothing on success

If "device" does not exist or cannot be determined, DeviceNotFound

B<Since:>

B<block-commit>  (Command)
Live commit of data from overlay image nodes into backing nodes - i.e.,
writes data between 'top' and 'base' into 'base'.

B<Arguments:>

=over 4


=item C<job-id: string> (optional)

identifier for the newly-created block job. If
omitted, the device name will be used. (Since 2.7)

=item C<device: string>

the device name or node-name of a root node

=item C<base-node: string> (optional)

The node name of the backing image to write data into.
If not specified, this is the deepest backing image.
(since: 3.1)

=item C<base: string> (optional)

Same as C<base-node>, except that it is a file name rather than a node
name. This must be the exact filename string that was used to open the
node; other strings, even if addressing the same file, are not
accepted (deprecated, use C<base-node> instead)

=item C<top-node: string> (optional)

The node name of the backing image within the image chain
which contains the topmost data to be committed down. If
not specified, this is the active layer. (since: 3.1)

=item C<top: string> (optional)

Same as C<top-node>, except that it is a file name rather than a node
name. This must be the exact filename string that was used to open the
node; other strings, even if addressing the same file, are not
accepted (deprecated, use C<base-node> instead)

=item C<backing-file: string> (optional)

The backing file string to write into the overlay
image of 'top'.  If 'top' is the active layer,
specifying a backing file string is an error. This
filename is not validated.

If a pathname string is such that it cannot be
resolved by QEMU, that means that subsequent QMP or
HMP commands must use node-names for the image in
question, as filename lookup methods will fail.

If not specified, QEMU will automatically determine
the backing file string to use, or error out if
there is no obvious choice. Care should be taken
when specifying the string, to specify a valid
filename or protocol.
(Since 2.1)

If top == base, that is an error.
If top == active, the job will not be completed by itself,
user needs to complete the job with the block-job-complete
command after getting the ready event. (Since 2.0)

If the base image is smaller than top, then the base image
will be resized to be the same size as top.  If top is
smaller than the base image, the base will not be
truncated.  If you want the base image size to match the
size of the smaller top, you can safely truncate it
yourself once the commit operation successfully completes.

=item C<speed: int> (optional)

the maximum speed, in bytes per second

=item C<filter-node-name: string> (optional)

the node name that should be assigned to the
filter driver that the commit job inserts into the graph
above C<top>. If this option is not given, a node name is
autogenerated. (Since: 2.9)

=item C<auto-finalize: boolean> (optional)

When false, this job will wait in a PENDING state after it has
finished its work, waiting for C<block-job-finalize> before
making any block graph changes.
When true, this job will automatically
perform its abort or commit actions.
Defaults to true. (Since 3.1)

=item C<auto-dismiss: boolean> (optional)

When false, this job will wait in a CONCLUDED state after it
has completely ceased all work, and awaits C<block-job-dismiss>.
When true, this job will automatically disappear from the query
list without user intervention.
Defaults to true. (Since 3.1)

B<block_set_io_throttle>  (Command)
Change I/O throttle limits for a block drive.

Since QEMU 2.4, each device with I/O limits is member of a throttle
group.

If two or more devices are members of the same group, the limits
will apply to the combined I/O of the whole group in a round-robin
fashion. Therefore, setting new I/O limits to a device will affect
the whole group.

The name of the group can be specified using the 'group' parameter.
If the parameter is unset, it is assumed to be the current group of
that device. If it's not in any group yet, the name of the device
will be used as the name for its group.

The 'group' parameter can also be used to move a device to a
different group. In this case the limits specified in the parameters
will be applied to the new group only.

I/O limits can be disabled by setting all of them to 0. In this case
the device will be removed from its group and the rest of its
members will not be affected. The 'group' parameter is ignored.

B<block-stream>  (Command)
Copy data from a backing file into a block device.

The block streaming operation is performed in the background until the entire
backing file has been copied.  This command returns immediately once streaming
has started.  The status of ongoing block streaming operations can be checked
with query-block-jobs.  The operation can be stopped before it has completed
using the block-job-cancel command.

The node that receives the data is called the top image, can be located in
any part of the chain (but always above the base image; see below) and can be
specified using its device or node name. Earlier qemu versions only allowed
'device' to name the top level node; presence of the 'base-node' parameter
during introspection can be used as a witness of the enhanced semantics
of 'device'.

If a base file is specified then sectors are not copied from that base file and
its backing chain.  When streaming completes the image file will have the base
file as its backing file.  This can be used to stream a subset of the backing
file chain instead of flattening the entire image.

On successful completion the image file is updated to drop the backing file
and the BLOCK_JOB_COMPLETED event is emitted.

B<Arguments:>

=over 4


=item C<job-id: string> (optional)

identifier for the newly-created block job. If
omitted, the device name will be used. (Since 2.7)

=item C<device: string>

the device or node name of the top image

=item C<base: string> (optional)

the common backing file name.
It cannot be set if C<base-node> is also set.

=item C<base-node: string> (optional)

the node name of the backing file.
It cannot be set if C<base> is also set. (Since 2.8)

=item C<backing-file: string> (optional)

The backing file string to write into the top
image. This filename is not validated.

If a pathname string is such that it cannot be
resolved by QEMU, that means that subsequent QMP or
HMP commands must use node-names for the image in
question, as filename lookup methods will fail.

If not specified, QEMU will automatically determine
the backing file string to use, or error out if there
is no obvious choice.  Care should be taken when
specifying the string, to specify a valid filename or
protocol.
(Since 2.1)

=item C<speed: int> (optional)

the maximum speed, in bytes per second

=item C<on-error: BlockdevOnError> (optional)

the action to take on an error (default report).
'stop' and 'enospc' can only be used if the block device
supports io-status (see BlockInfo).  Since 1.3.

=item C<auto-finalize: boolean> (optional)

When false, this job will wait in a PENDING state after it has
finished its work, waiting for C<block-job-finalize> before
making any block graph changes.
When true, this job will automatically
perform its abort or commit actions.
Defaults to true. (Since 3.1)

B<block-job-cancel>  (Command)
Stop an active background block operation.

This command returns immediately after marking the active background block
operation for cancellation.  It is an error to call this command if no
operation is in progress.

The operation will cancel as soon as possible and then emit the
BLOCK_JOB_CANCELLED event.  Before that happens the job is still visible when
enumerated using query-block-jobs.

Note that if you issue 'block-job-cancel' after 'drive-mirror' has indicated
(via the event BLOCK_JOB_READY) that the source and destination are
synchronized, then the event triggered by this command changes to
BLOCK_JOB_COMPLETED, to indicate that the mirroring has ended and the
destination now has a point-in-time copy tied to the time of the cancellation.

For streaming, the image file retains its backing file unless the streaming
operation happens to complete just as it is being cancelled.  A new streaming
operation can be started at a later time to finish copying all data from the
backing file.

B<Arguments:>

=over 4


=item C<device: string>

The job identifier. This used to be a device name (hence
the name of the parameter), but since QEMU 2.7 it can have

B<block-job-pause>  (Command)
Pause an active background block operation.

This command returns immediately after marking the active background block
operation for pausing.  It is an error to call this command if no
operation is in progress or if the job is already paused.

The operation will pause as soon as possible.  No event is emitted when
the operation is actually paused.  Cancelling a paused job automatically
resumes it.

B<Arguments:>

This command also clears the error status of the job.

B<Arguments:>

B<block-job-complete>  (Command)
Manually trigger completion of an active background block operation.  This
is supported for drive mirroring, where it also switches the device to
write to the target path only.  The ability to complete is signaled with
a BLOCK_JOB_READY event.

This command completes an active background block operation synchronously.
The ordering of this command's return with the BLOCK_JOB_COMPLETED event
is not defined.  Note that if an I/O error occurs during the processing of
this command: 1) the command itself will fail; 2) the error will be processed
according to the rerror/werror arguments that were specified when starting
the operation.

A cancelled or paused job cannot be completed.

B<block-job-dismiss>  (Command)
For jobs that have already concluded, remove them from the block-job-query
list. This command only needs to be run for jobs which were started with
QEMU 2.12+ job lifetime management semantics.

This command will refuse to operate on any job that has not yet reached
its terminal state, JOB_STATUS_CONCLUDED. For jobs that make use of the
BLOCK_JOB_READY event, block-job-cancel or block-job-complete will still need

block driver name

=item C<node-name: string> (optional)

the node name of the new node (Since 2.0).
This option is required on the top level of blockdev-add.
Valid node names start with an alphabetic character and may
contain only alphanumeric characters, '-', '.' and '_'. Their
maximum length is 31 characters.

the default value does not work and the option must be
specified explicitly.

=item C<auto-read-only: boolean> (optional)

if true and C<read-only> is false, QEMU may automatically
decide not to open the image read-write as requested, but
fall back to read-only instead (and switch between the modes
later), e.g. depending on whether the image file is writable
or whether a writing user is attached to the node
(default: false, since 3.1)

B<blockdev-open-tray>  (Command)
Opens a block device's tray. If there is a block driver state tree inserted as
a medium, it will become inaccessible to the guest (but it will remain
associated to the block device, so closing the tray will make it accessible
again).

If the tray was already open before, this will be a no-op.

Once the tray opens, a DEVICE_TRAY_MOVED event is emitted. There are cases in
which no such event will be generated, these include:

B<x-blockdev-change>  (Command)
Dynamically reconfigure the block driver state graph. It can be used
to add, remove, insert or replace a graph node. Currently only the
Quorum driver implements this feature to add or remove its child. This
is useful to fix a broken quorum child.

If C<node> is specified, it will be inserted under C<parent>. C<child>
may not be specified in this case. If both C<parent> and C<child> are
specified but C<node> is not, C<child> will be detached from C<parent>.

B<Note:>
this command is experimental, and its API is not stable. It
does not support all kinds of operations, all kinds of children, nor
all block drivers.

FIXME Removing children from a quorum node means introducing gaps in the
child indices. This cannot be represented in the 'children' list of
BlockdevOptionsQuorum, as returned by .bdrv_refresh_filename().

'sysrq' was mistakenly added to hack around the fact that
the ps2 driver was not generating correct scancodes sequences
when 'alt+print' was pressed. This flaw is now fixed and the
'sysrq' key serves no further purpose. Any further use of
'sysrq' will be transparently changed to 'print', so they
are effectively synonyms.

configured input routing (see docs/multiseat.txt) for those input
devices.  The parameters work exactly like the device and head
properties of input devices.  If C<device> is missing, only devices
that have no input routing config are admissible.  If C<device> is
specified, both input devices with and without input routing config
are admissible, but devices with input routing config take
precedence.

B<MigrationCapability> (Enum)


Migration capabilities enumeration

B<Values:>

=over 4


=item C<xbzrle>

Migration supports xbzrle (Xor Based Zero Run Length Encoding).
This feature allows us to minimize migration traffic for certain work
loads, by sending compressed difference of the pages

=item C<rdma-pin-all>

Controls whether or not the entire VM memory footprint is
mlock()'d on demand or all at once. Refer to docs/rdma.txt for usage.
Disabled by default. (since 2.0)

=item C<zero-blocks>

During storage migration encode blocks of zeroes efficiently. This
essentially saves 1MB of zeroes per block on the wire. Enabling requires
source and target VM to support this feature. To enable it is sufficient
to enable the capability on the source VM. The feature is disabled by
default. (since 1.6)

=item C<compress>

Use multiple compression threads to accelerate live migration.
This feature can help to reduce the migration traffic, by sending
compressed pages. Please note that if compress and xbzrle are both
on, compress only takes effect in the ram bulk stage, after that,
it will be disabled and only xbzrle takes effect, this can help to
minimize migration traffic. The feature is disabled by default.
(since 2.4 )

=item C<events>

generate events for each migration state change
(since 2.4 )

=item C<auto-converge>

If enabled, QEMU will automatically throttle down the guest
to speed up convergence of RAM migration. (since 1.6)

=item C<postcopy-ram>

Start executing on the migration target before all of RAM has
been migrated, pulling the remaining pages along as needed. The
capacity must have the same setting on both source and target
or migration will not even start. NOTE: If the migration fails during
postcopy the VM will fail.  (since 2.6)

=item C<x-colo>

If enabled, migration will never end, and the state of the VM on the
primary side will be migrated continuously to the VM on secondary
side, this process is called COarse-Grain LOck Stepping (COLO) for
Non-stop Service. (since 2.8)

=item C<release-ram>

if enabled, qemu will free the migrated ram pages on the source
during postcopy-ram migration. (since 2.9)

=item C<block>

If enabled, QEMU will also migrate the contents of all block
devices.  Default is disabled.  A possible alternative uses
mirror jobs to a builtin NBD server on the destination, which
offers more flexibility.
(Since 2.10)

=item C<return-path>

If enabled, migration will use the return path even
for precopy. (since 2.10)

=item C<pause-before-switchover>

Pause outgoing migration before serialising device
state and before disabling block IO (since 2.11)

=item C<x-multifd>

Use more than one fd for migration (since 2.11)

=item C<dirty-bitmaps>

If enabled, QEMU will migrate named dirty bitmaps.
(since 2.12)

=item C<postcopy-blocktime>

Calculate downtime for postcopy live migration
(since 3.0)

=item C<late-block-activate>

If enabled, the destination will not activate block
devices (and thus take locks) immediately at the end of migration.

=item C<decompress-threads>

Set decompression thread count to be used in live
migration, the decompression thread count is an integer between 1

B<transaction>  (Command)
Executes a number of transactionable QMP commands atomically. If any
operation fails, then the entire set of actions will be abandoned and the
appropriate error returned.

For external snapshots, the dictionary contains the device, the file to use for
the new snapshot, and the format.  The default format, if not specified, is
qcow2.

Each new snapshot defaults to being created by QEMU (wiping any
contents if the file already exists), but it is also possible to reuse
an externally-created file.  In the latter case, you should ensure that
the new image file has the same contents as the current one; QEMU cannot
perform any meaningful check.  Typically this is achieved by using the
current image file as the backing file for the new image.

On failure, the original disks pre-snapshot attempt will be used.

For internal snapshots, the dictionary contains the device and the snapshot's
name.  If an internal snapshot matching name already exists, the request will
be rejected.  Only some image formats support it, for example, qcow2, rbd,
and sheepdog.

On failure, qemu will try delete the newly created internal snapshot in the
transaction.  When an I/O error occurs during deletion, the user needs to fix
it later with qemu-img or other command.

=item C<actions: array of TransactionAction>

Therefore, if C<vcpu> is given, the operation will only match per-vCPU events,
returning their state on the specified vCPU. Special case: if C<name> is an
exact match, C<vcpu> is given and the event does not have the "vcpu" property,
an error is returned.

=head2 QMP introspection




B<query-qmp-schema>  (Command)
Command query-qmp-schema exposes the QMP wire ABI as an array of
SchemaInfo.  This lets QMP clients figure out what commands and
events are available in this QEMU, and their parameters and results.

However, the SchemaInfo can't reflect all the rules and restrictions
that apply to QMP.  It's interface introspection (figuring out
what's there), not interface specification.  The specification is in
the QAPI schema.

Furthermore, while we strive to keep the QMP wire format
backwards-compatible across qemu versions, the introspection output
is not guaranteed to have the same stability.  For example, one
version of qemu may list an object member as an optional
non-variant, while another lists the same member only through the
object's variants; or the type of a member may change from a generic
string into a specific enum or from one specific type into an
alternate that includes the original type alongside something else.

B<Returns:>
array of C<SchemaInfo>, where each element describes an
entity in the ABI: command, event, type, ...

The order of the various SchemaInfo is unspecified; however, all

B<Note:>
This example has been shortened as the real response is too long.






B<quit>  (Command)
This command will cause the QEMU process to exit gracefully.  While every
attempt is made to send the QMP response before terminating, this is not
guaranteed.  When using this interface, a premature EOF would not be
unexpected.

B<Since:>
0.14.0

B<Example:>
	
	-> { "execute": "quit" }
	<- { "return": {} }







B<stop>  (Command)
Stop all guest VCPU execution.

B<Since:>
0.14.0

B<Notes:>
This function will succeed even if the guest is already in the stopped
state.  In "inmigrate" state, it will ensure that the guest
remains paused once migration finishes, as if the -S option was
passed on the command line.

B<Example:>
	
	-> { "execute": "stop" }
	<- { "return": {} }







B<system_reset>  (Command)
Performs a hard reset of a guest.

B<Since:>
0.14.0

B<Example:>
	
	-> { "execute": "system_reset" }
	<- { "return": {} }







B<system_powerdown>  (Command)
Requests that a guest perform a powerdown operation.

B<Since:>
0.14.0

B<Notes:>
A guest may or may not respond to this command.  This command
returning does not indicate that a guest has accepted the request or
that it has shut down.  Many guests will respond to this command by
prompting the user in some way.

B<Example:>
	
	-> { "execute": "system_powerdown" }
	<- { "return": {} }







B<cpu-add>  (Command)
Adds CPU with specified ID

	<- { "return": {} }







B<cont>  (Command)
Resume guest VCPU execution.

B<Since:>
0.14.0

B<Returns:>
If successful, nothing

B<Notes:>
This command will succeed if the guest is currently running.  It
will also succeed if the guest is in the "inmigrate" state; in
this case, the effect of the command is to make sure the guest
starts once migration finishes, removing the effect of the -S
command line option if it was passed.

B<Example:>
	
	-> { "execute": "cont" }
	<- { "return": {} }







B<x-exit-preconfig>  (Command)
Exit from "preconfig" state

This command makes QEMU exit the preconfig state and proceed with
VM initialization using configuration data provided on the command line
and via the QMP monitor during the preconfig state. The command is only
available during the preconfig state (i.e. when the --preconfig command
line option was in use).

Since 3.0

B<Returns:>
nothing

B<Example:>
	
	-> { "execute": "x-exit-preconfig" }
	<- { "return": {} }







B<system_wakeup>  (Command)
Wakeup guest from suspend.  Does nothing in case the guest isn't suspended.

B<Since:>
1.1

B<Returns:>
nothing.

B<Example:>
	
	-> { "execute": "system_wakeup" }
	<- { "return": {} }







B<inject-nmi>  (Command)
Injects a Non-Maskable Interrupt into the default CPU (x86/s390) or all CPUs (ppc64).
The command fails when the guest doesn't support injecting.

B<Returns:>
If successful, nothing

B<Since:>
0.14.0

B<Note:>
prior to 2.1, this command was only supported for x86 and s390 VMs

B<Example:>
	
	-> { "execute": "inject-nmi" }
	<- { "return": {} }







B<balloon>  (Command)
Request the balloon driver to change its balloon size.

B<Arguments:>

=over 4


=item C<value: int>

the target size of the balloon in bytes

=back


B<Returns:>
Nothing on success
If the balloon driver is enabled but not functional because the KVM
kernel module cannot support it, KvmMissingCap
If no balloon device is present, DeviceNotActive

B<Notes:>
This command just issues a request to the guest.  When it returns,
the balloon size may not have changed.  A guest can change the balloon
size independent of this command.

B<Since:>
0.14.0

B<Example:>
	
	-> { "execute": "balloon", "arguments": { "value": 536870912 } }
	<- { "return": {} }







B<human-monitor-command>  (Command)
Execute a command on the human monitor and return the output.

B<Arguments:>

=over 4


=item C<command-line: string>

the command to execute in the human monitor

=item C<cpu-index: int> (optional)

The CPU to use for commands that require an implicit CPU

=back


B<Returns:>
the output of the command as a string

B<Since:>
0.14.0

B<Notes:>
This command only exists as a stop-gap.  Its use is highly
discouraged.  The semantics of this command are not
guaranteed: this means that command names, arguments and
responses can change or be removed at ANY time.  Applications
that rely on long term stability guarantees should NOT
use this command.

Known limitations:


=over 4


=item *

This command is stateless, this means that commands that depend
on state information (such as getfd) might not work


=item *

Commands that prompt the user for data don't currently work

=back



B<Example:>
	
	-> { "execute": "human-monitor-command",
	     "arguments": { "command-line": "info kvm" } }
	<- { "return": "kvm support: enabled\r\n" }







B<ObjectPropertyInfo> (Object)




B<Members:>

=over 4


=item C<name: string>

the name of the property

=item C<type: string>

the type of the property.  This will typically come in one of four
forms:

1) A primitive type such as 'u8', 'u16', 'bool', 'str', or 'double'.
These types are mapped to the appropriate JSON type.

2) A child type in the form 'childE<lt>subtypeE<gt>' where subtype is a qdev
device type name.  Child properties create the composition tree.

3) A link type in the form 'linkE<lt>subtypeE<gt>' where subtype is a qdev
device type name.  Link properties form the device model graph.

=item C<description: string> (optional)

if specified, the description of the property.

=back


B<Since:>

B<qom-list>  (Command)
This command will list any properties of a object given a path in the object
model.

B<Arguments:>

=over 4


=item C<path: string>

the path within the object model.  See C<qom-get> for a description of
this parameter.

=back


B<Returns:>
a list of C<ObjectPropertyInfo> that describe the properties of the
object.

B<Since:>
1.2






B<qom-get>  (Command)
This command will get a property from a object model path and return the
value.

B<Arguments:>

=over 4


=item C<path: string>

The path within the object model.  There are two forms of supported
paths--absolute and partial paths.

Absolute paths are derived from the root object and can follow childE<lt>E<gt>
or linkE<lt>E<gt> properties.  Since they can follow linkE<lt>E<gt> properties, they
can be arbitrarily long.  Absolute paths look like absolute filenames
and are prefixed  with a leading slash.

Partial paths look like relative filenames.  They do not begin
with a prefix.  The matching rules for partial paths are subtle but
designed to make specifying objects easy.  At each level of the
composition tree, the partial path is matched as an absolute path.
The first match is not returned.  At least two matches are searched
for.  A successful result is only returned if only one match is
found.  If more than one match is found, a flag is return to
indicate that the match was ambiguous.

=item C<property: string>

The property name to read

=back


B<Returns:>
The property value.  The type depends on the property
type. childE<lt>E<gt> and linkE<lt>E<gt> properties are returned as #str
pathnames.  All integer property types (u8, u16, etc) are
returned as #int.

B<Since:>
1.2






B<qom-set>  (Command)
This command will set a property from a object model path.

B<Arguments:>

=over 4


=item C<path: string>

see C<qom-get> for a description of this parameter

=item C<property: string>

the property name to set

=item C<value: value>

a value who's type is appropriate for the property type.  See C<qom-get>
for a description of type mapping.

=back

B<change>  (Command)
This command is multiple commands multiplexed together.

B<Arguments:>

=over 4


=item C<device: string>

This is normally the name of a block device but it may also be 'vnc'.
when it's 'vnc', then sub command depends on C<target>

=item C<target: string>

If C<device> is a block device, then this is the new filename.
If C<device> is 'vnc', then if the value 'password' selects the vnc
change password command.   Otherwise, this specifies a new server URI
address to listen to for VNC connections.

=item C<arg: string> (optional)

If C<device> is a block device, then this is an optional format to open
the device with.
If C<device> is 'vnc' and C<target> is 'password', this is the new VNC
password to set.  See change-vnc-password for additional notes.

=back


B<Returns:>
Nothing on success.
If C<device> is not a valid block device, DeviceNotFound

B<Notes:>
This interface is deprecated, and it is strongly recommended that you
avoid using it.  For changing block devices, use
blockdev-change-medium; for changing VNC parameters, use
change-vnc-password.

very long depending on the amount of guest memory.

B<Arguments:>

=over 4


=item C<paging: boolean>

if true, do paging to get guest's memory mapping. This allows
using gdb to process the core file.

IMPORTANT: this option can make QEMU allocate several gigabytes
of RAM. This can happen for a large guest, or a
malicious guest pretending to be large.

Also, paging=true has the following limitations:


=over 4


=item 1.

The guest may be in a catastrophic state or can have corrupted
memory, which cannot be trusted

=item 2.

The guest can be in real-mode even if paging is enabled. For
example, the guest uses ACPI to sleep, and ACPI sleep state
goes in real-mode

=item 3.

Virtual CPU definition.

B<Members:>

=over 4


=item C<name: string>

the name of the CPU definition

=item C<migration-safe: boolean> (optional)

whether a CPU definition can be safely used for
migration in combination with a QEMU compatibility machine
when migrating between different QEMU versions and between
hosts with different sets of (hardware or software)
capabilities. If not provided, information is not available
and callers should not assume the CPU definition to be
migration-safe. (since 2.8)

=item C<static: boolean>

(since 2.9)

=back

C<unavailable-features> is a list of QOM property names that
represent CPU model attributes that prevent the CPU from running.
If the QOM property is read-only, that means there's no known
way to make the CPU model run in the current host. Implementations
that choose not to provide specific information return the
property name "type".
If the property is read-write, it means that it MAY be possible
to run the CPU model in the current host if that property is
changed. Management software can use it as hints to suggest or
choose an alternative for the user, or just to generate meaningful
error messages explaining why the CPU model can't be used.
If C<unavailable-features> is an empty list, the CPU model is
runnable using the current host and machine-type.
If C<unavailable-features> is not present, runnability
information for the CPU is not available.

B<CpuModelExpansionType> (Enum)


An enumeration of CPU model expansion types.

B<Values:>

=over 4


=item C<static>

Expand to a static CPU model, a combination of a static base
model name and property delta changes. As the static base model will
never change, the expanded CPU model will be the same, independent of
QEMU version, machine type, machine options, and accelerator options.
Therefore, the resulting model can be used by tooling without having
to specify a compatibility machine - e.g. when displaying the "host"
model. The C<static> CPU models are migration-safe.

=item C<full>

Expand all properties. The produced model is not guaranteed to be
migration-safe, but allows tooling to get an insight and work with
model details.

=back


B<Note:>
When a non-migration-safe CPU model is expanded in static mode, some
features enabled by the CPU model may be omitted, because they can't be
implemented by a static CPU model definition (e.g. cache info passthrough and
PMU passthrough in x86). If you need an accurate representation of the
features enabled by a non-migration-safe CPU model, use C<full>. If you need a
static representation that will keep ABI compatibility even when changing QEMU
version or machine-type, use C<static> (but keep in mind that some features may
be omitted).

C<responsible-properties> is a list of QOM property names that led to
both CPUs not being detected as identical. For identical models, this
list is empty.
If a QOM property is read-only, that means there's no known way to make the
CPU models identical. If the special property name "type" is included, the
models are by definition not identical and cannot be made identical.

B<query-cpu-model-comparison>  (Command)
Compares two CPU models, returning how they compare in a specific
configuration. The results indicates how both models compare regarding
runnability. This result can be used by tooling to make decisions if a
certain CPU model will run in a certain configuration or if a compatible
CPU model has to be created by baselining.

Usually, a CPU model is compared against the maximum possible CPU model
of a certain configuration (e.g. the "host" model for KVM). If that CPU
model is identical or a subset, it will run in that configuration.

The result returned by this command may be affected by:
