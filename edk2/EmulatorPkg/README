
=== EmulatorPkg Overview ===

EmulatorPkg provides an environment where a UEFI environment can be
emulated under an environment where a full UEFI compatible
environment is not possible.  (For example, running under an OS
where an OS process hosts the UEFI emulation environment.)

=== Status ===

* Builds and runs under a posix-like environment with X windows
  - Linux
  - OS X

=== Future Plans ===

* Win32 and Win64 support

=== Build Scripts ===

On systems with the bash shell you can use EmulatorPkg/build.sh to simplify
building and running EmulatorPkg.

For example, to build + run:
$ EmulatorPkg/build.sh
$ EmulatorPkg/build.sh run

The build architecture will match your host machine's architecture.

On X64 host machines, you can build + run IA32 mode as well:
$ EmulatorPkg/build.sh -a IA32
$ EmulatorPkg/build.sh -a IA32 run
