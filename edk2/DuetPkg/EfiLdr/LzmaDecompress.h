/**
  Decompresses a Lzma compressed source buffer.

  Extracts decompressed data to its original form.
  If the compressed source data specified by Source is successfully decompressed 
  into Destination, then RETURN_SUCCESS is returned.  If the compressed source data 
  specified by Source is not in a valid compressed data format,
  then RETURN_INVALID_PARAMETER is returned.

  @param  Source      The source buffer containing the compressed data.
  @param  SourceSize  The size of source buffer.
  @param  Destination The destination buffer to store the decompressed data
  @param  Scratch     A temporary scratch buffer that is used to perform the decompression.
                      This is an optional parameter that may be NULL if the 
                      required scratch buffer size is 0.
                     
  @retval  RETURN_SUCCESS Decompression completed successfully, and 
                          the uncompressed buffer is returned in Destination.
  @retval  RETURN_INVALID_PARAMETER 
                          The source buffer specified by Source is corrupted
